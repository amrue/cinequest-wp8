Add images to film detail page

stop it from loading and parsing the XML page every time the films view shows up (caching)

include showtimes with each film detail

add a separator between in the film view so it's easier to see where you are

add the quick-jump feature to the list box

the films should be shown by each day, with an additional option to list them A-Z, do that

work on serialization to make populating Festival object easier/faster (better documentation should be available eventually)

make it look more like the Android app for cross-platform parity

fix the git setup so it ignore the /Bin and /obj folders since those are autogenerated by Visual Studio

switch it to a pivot application instead of screens, this better fits the Windows Phone environment
