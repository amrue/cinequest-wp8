Hey guys so I made what i believe are the required classes for the film page. I am not sure how you are connecting the data to the ui, your way looks way more sophisticated than the way i was doing it. let me know how they work.
So to actually make the internet connection you need

//put this in the constructor of the film page if that is going to be the first page
this.Loaded += new RoutedEventHandler(FilmMainPage_Loaded);

//then put this in the loaded method
WebClient webclient = new WebClient();
            webclient.DownloadStringCompleted += new DownloadStringCompletedEventHandler(webclient_DownloadStringCompleted);
            webclient.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri("http://mobile.cinequest.org/mobileCQ.php?type=festival"))


//then you will need this method

 void webclient_DownloadStringCompleted(object sender, DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.Error != null)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("error");
            }
            Festival festival = null;
            XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Festival));
            XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(e.Result);
            festival = (Festival)serializer.Deserialize(reader);
            reader.Close();
           /* FilmItemList list = new FilmItemList(festival);
            list.populateList();
            foreach (FilmItem item in list.Itemlist)
            {
                MainListBox.Items.Add(item);
            }*/
        }
//so this will created the festival object that should be populated with everything needed for the film page

let me know how if i need to make changes. If everything works out well il do the same thing for the rest of pages
